# HobbySrProject
College Projects

This was a senoir project for a college class.  This had a total of four contributors to the project.

This is a place to log the items of hobby collections, such as music, movies, or video games. 
Using this product it would be possible to track items lent out, and sort through an itemized list.
There is also a community component to the project for sharing and making meetings.
